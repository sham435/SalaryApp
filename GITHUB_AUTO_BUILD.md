# 🤖 BONUS: Auto-Build .EXE with GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Build .EXE Without Windows!

If you want to build the .exe **without accessing a Windows machine**, you can use GitHub Actions to build it automatically in the cloud!

---

## ⚡ QUICK SETUP (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# In your SalaryApp folder on Mac:
cd "/Users/sham4/my all app proj/Jatan_All_Projects/SalaryApp"

# Initialize git (if not already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Jatan Salary App"

# Create repo on GitHub.com (via web browser)
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SalaryApp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: GitHub Auto-Builds .EXE!

Once pushed, GitHub Actions will:
1. ✅ Set up Windows environment
2. ✅ Install Python and dependencies
3. ✅ Build JatanSalaryApp.exe
4. ✅ Save it for download

**Total time: ~5 minutes** (automated)

---

## 📥 DOWNLOAD YOUR .EXE

### After GitHub Actions completes:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. Click the latest workflow run
4. Scroll down to **"Artifacts"**
5. Download **"JatanSalaryApp-Windows"**
6. Extract the .exe
7. **Done!** 🎉

## 🎮 HOW TO USE

### **Option A: Auto-Build on Every Push**

Every time you push code to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated salary calculator"
git push
```

GitHub automatically builds new .exe! (5 min later it's ready)

### **Option B: Manual Build Trigger**

1. Go to your repo on GitHub.com
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click **"Build Windows EXE"** workflow
4. Click **"Run workflow"** button
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Download from Artifacts
